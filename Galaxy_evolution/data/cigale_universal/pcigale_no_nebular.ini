# File containing the input data. The columns are:
# * 'id': name of the object.
# * 'redshift': redshift of the object. If 0, the distance is assumed to
# be 10 pc. If negative the photometric mode is enabled. In that case an
# explicit redshift grid must be provided in the redshfting module.
# * 'distance' (Mpc, optional): distance in Mpc. Optional, if present it
# will be used in lieu of the distance computed from the redshift
# assuming a Planck et al. (2018) cosmology.
# * band fluxes: fluxes in filters in mJy. Each column is identified
# with a unique filter name, for instance jwst.nircam.F200W for the 2 μm
# filter of the NIRCAM instrument onboard JWST. The known filters are
# avalaible from the command 'pcigale-filters list'.
# * line fluxes: fluxes in lines in W/m². Each column is identified
# after a unique line name prefixed with 'line.', for instance
# line.H-alpha. The known filters are available from the command
# 'pcigale-filters list'. It is possible to combine lines together, for
# instance line.NII-654.8+H-alpha+NII-658.3 will be the sum of Hα and
# the adjacent NII lines.
# * physical properties: values of the intensive and extensive physical
# properties (e.g., dust.luminosity for the dust luminosity). To
# determine the format of the columns and the units, it is suggested to
# do a minimal run and examine the output FITS table.
# * uncertainties: the uncertainties for the band and line fluxes as
# well as for the physical properties are given using the same column
# names with the '_err' suffix.
# Important notes:
# * Fluxes can be positive or negative.
# * Upper limits are indicated with a negative value for the
# uncertainty.
# * In case some fluxes are missing for some objects, they can be
# replaced with NaN.
# * This file is optional to generate the configuration file, in
# particular for the savefluxes module.
